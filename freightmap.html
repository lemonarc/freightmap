              Freightmap, our powerful yet simple to use transport and logistics package operates in a number of transport environments. 
              Features to support warehousing, groupage, LCL, full load, national, European or worldwide can be enabled and disabled
              as required so your users only see the functionality they need.
              <p>
              Full integration with industry leading accounting packages such as Sage Line 50, means a seamless workflow through your business
              from quotes, to jobs, to loads and onto invoicing.
              <p>
              
              Freightmap is based on the industry leading <a href="http://www.oracle.com" title="Link to Oracle" class="siteButton" target="_new">Oracle</a> 
              database. Robust, high performance and scalable, sites with fewer than 5 users operate as efficiently as a site with 50.
              <p>
              With an impressive list of <a href="freightmap_features.html" onclick="parent.gourl('freightmap_features.html','nav2'); return false" title="Freightmap Feature List" class="siteButton">features</a>,
              Freightmap has something to offer all types of logistics companies.

               No two businesses are alike. The beauty of the Freightmap approach is that functionality which is not appropriate 
               to a particular user, department or company is completely hidden as appropriate.
               <p>
               In addition and within certain criteria, we will customise, tailor and/or add functionality to suit your particular business, 
               all at no cost to yourselves.
