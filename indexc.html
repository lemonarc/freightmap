              Telematics is an emerging technology within the transport sector, encompassing a range of technologies
              within a vehicle including Automatic Vehicle Location, Electronic POD and Satellite Navigation.
              <p>
              Many of the offerings facilitate only one or two of the features. As a fleet operator you would
              be required to obtain a number of disparate telematics systems from a range of providers. It is unlikely that 
              these systems would be able to integrate with your office based logistics software.
              <p>
              FreightMobile includes Automatic Vehicle Location, Electronic POD and Satellite Navigation within one unit. It is
              also fully integrated within Freightmap at your office.
              <p>
              Future plans for FreightMobile include the options of low bridge warnings and safety camera alerts as a no cost upgrade. This
              will truly offer a single solution for the diverse requirements of modern telematics systems.

              At Freightmap Solutions we believe that our customers should be able to concentrate on their business and not on their systems.
